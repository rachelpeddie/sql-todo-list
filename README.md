## The To-Do App

This is a an application that allows the user to create a to-do list.  They can add their tasks into the input field, click the 'Add Task' button, and their task will be listed below in a table.  Each task will include a 'Complete' button so the user can mark the task as completed, and a delete button to remove tasks from the list.

**Built With**
javascript
jquery
express
ajax



**Here are the specific components for the challenge:**

* Create a front end experience that allows a user to create a Task.
* When the Task is created, it should be stored inside of a database (SQL)
* Whenever a Task is created the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.
* Each Task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.
* When a Task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end. For example, the background of the task container could change from gray to green. The complete option should be  'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete.
* Whether or not a Task is complete should also be stored in the database.
* Deleting a Task should remove it both from the front end as well as the Database.

### Styling

Use CSS styling to move the aesthetic of the page beyond the vanilla HTML look:
  - background color of the page
  - font family and size
  - text color & or background color of tasks *to show whether or not they have been completed*

### Approach

We would recommend you spend some time thinking about how to approach this problem. Think through all the logic that will be needed prior to writing any code. Take your time, relax, remember that impostor syndrome is real, and that you are capable of knocking this out of the park!

### Create a Database

Be sure to create a new database through Postico. Use the name `weekend-to-do-app`. You will need to use this name in your database connection configuration on your server.

### Database Structure

Please include a `database.sql` text file in your repo that includes all of your `CREATE TABLE` queries. This is so we can re-create your database while testing your app.

## Stretch Goals

For each of your strech goals, you will be practicing git branching. Please refer to the branching notes for a reminder on commands. Each branch will be merged into master using `--no-ff`. This will allow us to see that you branched your feature when you turn in your code.
